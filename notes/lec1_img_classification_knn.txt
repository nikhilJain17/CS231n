What is Image Classification?
	- Input image
	- Output label corresponding to image

Image Classification is hard
	- lighting differences
	- size differences
	- deformation
	- viewpoint variation
	
It's not entirely clear how to INSTRUCT a computer to learn images

It's easier to give it positive and negative examples, and teach it
	- data-driven approach

Nearest Neighbor Classifier
	- simple and crude estimator
	- L1 norm: subtract raw pixel data differences, pixel by pixel
	- L2 norm: same thing but use Euclidean distance
	- return label of image with smallest difference from test img

In practice, Nearest Neighbor Classifiers are terrible for Image Classification
	- end up classifying based on color more than anything

We can marginally improve their performance with k-Nearest Neighbors
	- instead of returning label of closest neighbor, return label of k 
closest neighbors
	- pick label most represented in the k closest neighbors

How do you pick k?

It's a hyperparameter!

Don't tweak hyperparameters on test set, otherwise you will overfit to your test 
set
	- won't generalize well to other imgs

Validation
	- split training set into train and validation
		- train model on train
		- tweak hyperparameters on validation
			- n-folds cross validation: iterate through 
sections of training set as validation set
